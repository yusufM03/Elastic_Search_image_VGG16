# Elastic Search Image VGG16 Similarity

**Status:** In Progress

This project uses **ElasticSearch** with the **k-NN Plugin** for image similarity search. It applies the **VGG16 model** to extract image features, enabling efficient retrieval based on feature similarity and fuzzy search.

## First Steps

### Feature Extraction from Images

- Extract features from images using **VGG16**. These features represent high-level patterns and semantics of the images, enabling similarity-based retrieval.

### Set Up ElasticSearch and k-NN Plugin

To perform k-NN (k-nearest neighbor) search on the image features, set up **ElasticSearch** with the k-NN Plugin. The plugin allows efficient similarity search using vector data.

---

## Setting Up ElasticSearch and k-NN Plugin

1. **Docker Command to Set Up ElasticSearch:**

   Run the following **Docker** command to set up ElasticSearch:

   ```bash
   docker run --name elasticsearch --net elas -e "discovery.type=single-node" -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.15.2
   ```

2. **Install k-NN Plugin:**

   Once ElasticSearch is running, install the **k-NN plugin** to enable vector-based search:

   ```bash
   sudo bin/elasticsearch-plugin install "org.elasticsearch.plugin:knn:8.15.2"
   ```

---

## Index Mapping & Data Loading

### Define the Index Mapping

Create an **ElasticSearch index** with appropriate mapping to store image features as vectors. This will support the k-NN search functionality.

- Define the vector field for storing image features.
  
### Load CSV Data into ElasticSearch

Use **Logstash** or a direct Python script to load image feature vectors (extracted using VGG16) into your ElasticSearch index.

---

## Performing k-NN Search

Perform **k-NN** search to retrieve images similar to a given query. The search is based on the feature vectors that are stored in the ElasticSearch index.

### Different Methods of k-NN Plugin

- **Approximate k-NN:** This method is fast but less accurate.
  
- **Precise k-NN:** More accurate, but slower.

## Fuzzy Search and Dimensionality Reduction

### Dimensionality Reduction using PCA

It is recommended to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for better performance and reduced memory usage.

### Quantization for Memory Saving

Use **quantization** to convert the floating-point vectors into byte vectors, which helps in saving memory while still allowing for efficient similarity search.

### Filter Option (e.g., Tags)

You can add a **filter option** such as **tags** (e.g., image categories) to narrow down the search results, reducing the number of images to search.

## Testing

To test the search functionality, follow these steps:

1. Run **ElasticSearch** with the connection details mentioned above.
2. Launch the application by running:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

This will start the search interface where you can test the image similarity search and semantic search features.
